# lattice-cpp
[Lattice](https://github.com/rjb3977/Lattice), but in C++. And way faster. Although about 25% slower than [lattice-c](https://github.com/rjb3977/lattice-c). Requires [boost](https://www.boost.org/) (only the headers, i.e. libboost-dev on Ubuntu), [gmp](https://gmplib.org/), a modern C++ capable compiler (I personally use [clang-10](https://clang.llvm.org/) with [libc++-10](https://libcxx.llvm.org/)), and [meson](https://mesonbuild.com/).
