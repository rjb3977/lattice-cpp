# lattice-cpp
[Lattice](https://github.com/rjb3977/Lattice), but in C++. And way faster. Although about 25% slower than [lattice-c](https://github.com/rjb3977/lattice-c).

### Requirements
- [boost](https://boost.org/)
- [gmp](https://gmplib.org/)
- A modern c++ compiler (I use [clang-10](https://clang.llvm.org/) with [libc++-10](https://libcxx.llvm.org/))
- [meson](https://mesonbuild.com/)
